# SimpleCalorieCounter

Developed a simple calorie counter web application with purpose to track the meals of each unique
user. Worked with NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store user data. Using MeteorJS framework as the main
stack for the application. Utilized AngularJS as the client side framework along with HTML/Twitter
Bootstrap for CSS. 

Simple application to track down calories and meals. Full function application is functional and 
has been deployed on MeteorJS cloud (http://caloriecounter.meteor.com/), however I would like
to add more functions to make it even more useful.
